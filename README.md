# Project Overview

## Introduction
This project is dedicated to the development of a robust backend system designed to handle application metrics with efficiency and scalability. At the core of this system lies **MongoDB**, a dynamic NoSQL database known for its high throughput and exceptional support for numerous concurrent insert operations.

## MongoDB: A Strategic Choice
**MongoDB** excels in managing unstructured data, offering powerful search capabilities that are essential for today's data-driven applications. While it does not adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties by default, the trade-off is deemed acceptable within scenarios where data loss is tolerable. For our purposes, MongoDB emerges as the optimal choice, balancing performance with flexibility.

## Conclusion
By leveraging MongoDB's strengths and pairing it with effective event handling and caching strategies, this project aims to deliver a backend solution that is not only performant but also scalable and resilient. It stands as a testament to our commitment to building state-of-the-art technology solutions.
